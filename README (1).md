GROUP 7 SUMMARY


TOPIC 1: INTRODUCTION TO IT AND STATS

IT is the use of computers, networks, softwares and systems to gather store, analyze, model and communicate data. Statistics are raw facts Software, is a set of instructions that tell a computer what to do and how to do it. Information is processed data.

Application of IT

Processing data Analyzing/processing data Storing data Presenting data in an organised way.

Role of IT in the society

Transport Used in GPS software and controlling traffic lights.

Security Used in surveillance

Education Used as a way to access learning materials.

Agriculture Track crop growth, weather patterns and soil health.

Data VS Information Data is is a raw fact/statistic and is often the input. Information is processed data and is often the output.

A computer is an electonic device that processes and stores data.

Types of computers. Supercomputers - they are huge, powerful and are used for complex calculations. Mainframe - large and are used to process complex data. Minicomputers - small and used in small businesses. Microcomputers/PCs - are the personal computers for daily use.

Characteristic. Speed - does tasks very fast. Accuracy - provides accurate info most times. Automation - can work on its own once given instructions. Storage - can store huge amounts of data. Versatility - can do many different tasks. Connectivity - can connect to other networks or computers to share/receive data.

TOPIC 2 : FUNDAMENTALS OF COMPUTER OPERATIONS.

Computers work by following set instructions given to it telling it what to do and how to do it. CPU: Central Processing Unit - it is the main thinking component of a computer. ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit): does maths and logic like adding numbers or comparing values. Control Unit: directs data flow between CPU, memory, and devices. e.g., tells the printer when to print. Registers: small, super-fast memory inside CPU for temp data. e.g., storing a number before adding it to another. System Clock: keeps operations in sync, sets pace of processing. Higher clock speed = programs run faster. Machine Cycle: CPU works in steps: fetch → decode → execute → store. Parallel Processing: using more than one core or processor at same time to finish tasks faster. e.g., running browser, Excel,etc. Performance: depends on CPU speed, number of cores, and memory size. affects how fast tasks like analyzing big datasets in Excel or Python are completed.

TOPIC 3: COMPUTER HARDWARE 1(INPUT AND OUTPUT) Input and output devices are how we interact with computers. They let us give info to the computer and get results back. Input Devices: are hardware components that send data and control signals to a computer system. e.g., keyboard, mouse, scanner, microphone, camera. Keyboard – Allow users to type text and commands. Mouse – Enable users to move a cursor and select items on a screen. scanners – convert paper docs to digital files Microphone/camera – record audio/video Output Devices: are pieces of computer hardware that convert processed data from a computer into a human-understandable form, such as visual, audio, or printed information. e.g., monitor, printer, speaker, projector. Monitors – display images/text Printers – make paper copies Speakers – play sounds/music Projectors – show presentations or videos High-throughput devices: devices that handle lots of data fast. e.g., high-speed scanners in labs or cameras for experiments. Performance: how fast and correct these devices work is measured by speed, accuracy, and reliability. e.g., printing a big report, scanning multiple pages, etc.

TOPIC 4: COMPUTER HARDWARE 2(STORAGE DEVICES AND MEMORY) Computers need memory and storage to keep info temporarily or permanently. Understanding the types helps manage big data. Primary Memory: fast, temporary storage used while the computer is running. e.g., RAM stores data , ROM holds basic instructions for starting the computer. Secondary Memory: permanent storage for files and programs. e.g., HDDs, SSDs, or cloud storage like Google Drive. Cache Memory: very small, super-fast memory near the CPU to store frequently used data. e.g., helps Excel calculations run faster without fetching from RAM each time. RAID: combines multiple drives for speed data redundancy or both. e.g., a lab storing lots of experiment data safely. Disk Structure: disks are divided into tracks, sectors, clusters, and surfaces, which affects read/write speed. e.g., reading a large dataset is faster if data is organized well. Big Data Implications: organizing memory and storage matters for large datasets, like biostatistics or financial info. e.g., using SSD instead of HDD speeds up data retrieval.

Memory Unit Memory Unit: part of the computer that stores data and instructions temporarily or permanently so the CPU can use them.

PRIMARY MEMORY V SECONDARY MEMORY Primary Memory: fast, temporary memory used by the CPU while programs are running. Examples: RAM – stores files or programs you’re using now; lost when the computer is off. ROM – stores instructions for starting the computer; permanent. Key points: fast, small, temporary, directly accessed by CPU. Secondary Memory: permanent storage for files, programs, and data. Examples: HDD, SSD, USB drives, cloud storage. Key points: slower than primary, can hold large amounts of data, not lost when computer is off. NB: primary = working memory (used now), secondary = long-term storage (kept forever).

TOPIC 5: COMPUTER SOFTWARE Software tells the computer what to do. Without software, hardware is useless.

System Software: helps run the computer and manage hardware. Operating Systems (OS): controls hardware, runs programs, manages files. e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux. Compilers: turn programming code into instructions the computer can understand. e.g., Python compiler turns code into executable tasks. Utilities: small programs for maintenance, like antivirus, disk cleanup, or backup tools. Application Software: programs we use to do tasks. Examples: Word – write documents, Excel – do calculations and tables, Access – manage databases, PowerPoint – make presentations. Workflow Optimization: software can make tasks faster or easier. e.g., using Excel formulas instead of calculating by hand, or macros to automate repetitive tasks. Practical Tip: learning system software and basic apps helps with parallel computations and handling big datasets. e.g., running multiple analyses in Excel while using Python scripts.

Types of Application Software Word Processing Software: used to create, edit, and format text documents.Examples: Microsoft Word, Google Docs. Spreadsheet Software: used to organize, calculate, and analyze data in tables.Examples: Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets. Database Software: used to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently.Examples: Microsoft Access, MySQL, Oracle. Presentation Software: used to create slideshows for teaching, meetings, or reports.Examples: Microsoft PowerPoint, Google Slides. Graphics and Multimedia Software: used to edit images, videos, or audio.Examples: Adobe Photoshop, Canva, Audacity. Web Browsers and Communication Software: used to access the internet, email, and online communication.Examples: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Zoom, Outlook. Specialized Software: software designed for specific tasks, like statistical analysis, engineering, or gaming.Examples: SPSS for statistics, AutoCAD for design

TOPIC 6: DATA FILES AND DATA MANAGEMENT Computers store data in files. Learning how to manage files is important for organizing and retrieving information efficiently.

Types of Files: Random Files: can access any record directly without reading others. e.g., database tables where you can go to any row instantly. Sequential Files: data must be read in order. e.g., old log files or text files where you read line by line. Structured Files: organized in a fixed format. e.g., Excel spreadsheets or CSV files. Unstructured Files: no fixed format, harder to search. e.g., videos, images, or Word documents. File Creation & Management: involves making files, organizing them in folders, and naming them properly. e.g., saving lab data in separate folders by date or experiment. Indexing & Retrieval: helps locate data faster. e.g., using an index in a database to find a student’s record quickly. Optimization: arranging files and folders for better performance. e.g., keeping large datasets on SSD for faster access. Relational Databases: store data in tables connected by relationships. e.g., student info table linked to grades table in Access or SQL. Normalization: organizing database tables to reduce duplication and improve efficiency. e.g., separating student contact info from grades to avoid repeating the same data. Practical Tip: creating, managing, and querying datasets in Access or SQL helps you handle large amounts of data efficiently. e.g., filtering exam results or checking for missing entries.
